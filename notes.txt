Hints:
set timeouts to locks, to expire (timelocks)
this requires two things 
- implement what happens when the timeout expires
- study which thing takes what time

- construct the program on basis o 
> theoretically not knowing anything from the context
-
> knowwing something from the context 
- setting priority, time etc. 

separate the purpose of the job 
- is it computing, IO, communication?
separating the tasks as much as you can
since for example communication (messaging) is time consuming.
